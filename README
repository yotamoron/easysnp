Directory structure
===================

- Each application should have at least the following directories:
    - static: Static (CSS, JS, JPG etc) files that are only relevant to the
      application are stored in this folder. Django will know to look for the
      files in each static application's 'static' directory. 
      NOTE: files with the same name in different static directories have 
      undefined behaviour

    - templates: templates that are only relevant to this application are stored
      in this directory. Django will automatically know to look for the 
      template files.
      NOTE: files with the same name in different templates static directories 
      have undefined behaviour
